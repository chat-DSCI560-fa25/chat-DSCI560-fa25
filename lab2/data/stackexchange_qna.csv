What is the distribution of puzzle pieces in a puzzle?,"I was thinking about this question while doing a jigsaw puzzle with my girlfriend. In any puzzle, ignoring edge pieces, up to rotation there are 6 type of pieces. However, to make the puzzle completable these cannot be truly randomly distributed in the puzzle: any ""in-edge"" has to be connected to an ""out-edge"" To ignore the edge pieces, assume any puzzle to be toroidal. That is, the top connects to the bottom, and the left loops around to the right. So, my question is, what's the formula for the average distribution of the types of puzzle pieces in an $n$ -by- $m$ toroidal puzzle? (By symmetry, you may assume $m\geq n$ ) In edge cases like $n=1$ the question is very easy (there is only one option that works), but it becomes very interesting for higher numbers. Edit: I miscalculated for $n=1$ . Leaving it in for posterity.","If you assume each of the four edges of a piece (only considering interior pieces) points in either direction with probability $\frac12$ independently of the other edges of that piece, then I would have thought that, for an individual piece, the probability of four out-edges is $\frac{1}{16}$ , of four in-edges is $\frac{1}{16}$ , of three out-edges and one in-edge is $\frac{4}{16}$ , of three in-edges and one out-edge is $\frac{4}{16}$ , of out-out-in-in edges is $\frac{4}{16}$ , and of out-in-out-in edges is $\frac{2}{16}$ . As you say, there are six types. Adjacent pieces are not independent of each other, which is why you need $m>1,n>1$ on your torus so no piece is self-adjacent.",https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5094813/what-is-the-distribution-of-puzzle-pieces-in-a-puzzle
Integrate : $\sqrt{\frac{a-x}{x-b}}$ has 2 answers,"I came a across this integration problem today. $$
\int \sqrt{\frac{a-x}{x-b}} \;dx
$$ There seems to be 2 possible solutions. $$
 \sqrt{(a-x)(x-b)} - (a-b) \arctan{\sqrt{\frac{a-x}{x-b}}}+C
$$ or $$
\sqrt{(a-x)(x-b)} + \bigg(\frac{a - b}{2}\bigg)\arcsin\bigg(\frac{x - \frac{a+b}{2}}{\frac{a-b}{2}}\bigg) + C

"Number of north-eastern lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ such that it doesn't touch the line $y=mx+c$ where m is rational.","The bounty expires in 6 days . Answers to this question are eligible for a +50 reputation bounty. q123LsaB wants to draw more attention to this question. What I know (for slope= $1$ ). For the line $x - y + c = 0$ with $c \ge 1$ (equivalently $y = x + c$ ), “bad” paths (those that touch the line) are in bijection with paths from $(-c,c)$ to $(a,b)$ by reflection across $x-y+c=0$ . Hence the number of “good” paths is $$\binom{a+b}{a} \;-\; \binom{a+b}{a+c}$$ . What I want to know if its possible to generalise this for m to be a rational slope: 1)Integer slope $k$ : Number of good paths such that the the line $kx-y+c=0$ is not touched for $k$ being an integer and more than equal to $1$ . 2)Rational slope $\frac{m}{n}$ Number of good paths such that the the line $mx-ny+c=0$ is not touched for $m,n$ being integers greater than or  equal to $1$ . I was not able to solve either of these by the same idea of reflecting $(0,0)$ about the line, since they lead to points which are not integers.
I was wondering if there are some books/articles which exactly discusses this.","I think we can find the number when the slope is rational. I think the paper written in ploosu2's comment is very helpful. Let $a,b,c,m,n$ be positive integers satisfying $\frac cn\le b\lt \frac{ma}{n}+\frac cn$ . We want to find the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ staying strictly below the line $mx-ny+c=0$ , i.e. $y=\frac mnx+\frac cn$ . This is equal to the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ staying weakly below $y=\frac mnx+\frac cn\color{red}{-\frac 1n}$ , i.e. $mx=ny-c+1$ . The paper in ploosu2's comment shows, in pages from 18 to 20, how to find the number of paths from the origin to an arbitrary end point staying weakly below $\nu x = \mu y−\rho$ . Therefore, we can say that we can find the number when the slope is rational (and of course also when the slope is an integer larger than $1$ ). Let us see an example. For $(a,b,c,m,n)=(4,3,2,2,3)$ , we want to find the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(4,3)$ staying strictly below $2x-3y+2=0$ , i.e. $y=\frac 23x+\frac 23$ . This is equal to the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(4,3)$ staying weakly below $y=\frac 23x+\frac 23-\frac 13$ , i.e. $2x=3y-1$ . The paper says in page 20 that for $n$ odd, the number of paths from $(0,0)$ to $(\frac{3n-1}{2},n)$ staying weakly below $2x=3y-1$ is $\frac{2}{1+5n}\binom{\frac 12+\frac 52n}{n}$ . So, taking $n=3$ , we see that the number we want is $\frac{1}{8}\binom{8}{3}=7$ . We can see that this is correct since there are exactly seven paths from $(0,0)$ to $(4,3)$ staying strictly below $2x-3y+2=0$ , i.e. $y=\frac 23x+\frac 23$ as follows : (1) $(0,0)\to (4,0)\to (4,3)$ (2) $(0,0)\to (3,0)\to (3,1)\to (4,1)\to (4,3)$ (3) $(0,0)\to (3,0)\to (3,2)\to (4,2)\to (4,3)$ (4) $(0,0)\to (2,0)\to (2,1)\to (4,1)\to (4,3)$ (5) $(0,0)\to (2,0)\to (2,1)\to (3,1)\to (3,2)\to (4,3)$ (6) $(0,0)\to (1,0)\to (1,1)\to (4,1)\to (4,3)$ (7) $(0,0)\to (1,0)\to (1,1)\to (3,1)\to (3,2)\to (4,3)$",https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5094327/number-of-north-eastern-lattice-paths-from-0-0-to-a-b-such-that-it-doesn
Algorithm to lay out orthogonal connector lines without overlap,"I'm drawing a graph of nodes connected by orthogonal edges with corners. The nodes are laid out on a grid, and the edges (conceptually) follow the grid lines. The paths the edges take are laid out with an A* pathfinder, and I'd like to keep those paths. However, obviously some edges will overlap -- that is, cover the same lines on the grid. A naive approach to laying out the edges just has them on top of one another (as in the left-hand diagram below). I would like to take a ""metro map"" approach (similar to the London Underground map, etc) where edges are slightly offset from the grid lines exactly in order that edges do not overlap. Is there an existing algorithm for laying out such edges?","I don't know about existing algorithms, but I would implement a solution to your problem something like the following. Create a data structure to store, for each section of grid line, which path segments follow it, where each segment is placed on its own ""track"". Then for each path segment, find the next track that is available for all the required grid line sections. Something like this: calc a* paths
split paths at their corners into segments
keep a list of ""tracks"" for each section of grid line

for each segment:

    # find next empty track
    while true: (track loop)

        # check track empty for all line sections
        for each grid line section covered by segment:
            if track not empty:
                next track
                continue track loop

        break track loop

    # record line segment in track
    for each grid line section covered by segment:
        record segment in line section's track

render line segments by offsetting from grid line
